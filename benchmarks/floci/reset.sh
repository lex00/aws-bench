#
# Three things bite if you skip any of them, and each fails in a way that blames
# the arm rather than the reset:
#
#   1. `docker compose down -v` does NOT remove the floci-ec2-* containers. Floci
#      creates them as siblings through the Docker socket, outside the compose
#      project, so they survive and keep host ports 2200-2299 and 30000+. The next
#      arm's instances then fail to launch with "port is already allocated" and go
#      straight to `terminated` — which Terraform reports as "unexpected state
#      'terminated', wanted target 'running'".
#   2. An arm's IaC state survives the wipe. Terraform tries to reconcile against
#      resources that no longer exist; Pulumi tries to *update* a launch template
#      that is gone.
#   3. A failed deploy leaves partial state behind (SSM /exports parameters, named
#      IAM policies, launch templates). Retrying without a full wipe collides with
#      the previous attempt's leftovers.
