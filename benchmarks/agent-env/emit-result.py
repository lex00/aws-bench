"""Turn a scored job into one portable result set, with its provenance attached.

A score is only meaningful alongside the conditions that produced it: which
harness, which briefing, whether the gates passed, and whether the arm needed to
read the cloud to answer. Those live in four different places right now — the
job's result.json, the audit's output, the git worktree, the briefing file — so
quoting a number means re-deriving them, and re-deriving them is how "24/24"
ends up travelling without the fact that it was the top of a 20-24 band.

This writes one JSON file per (bench, scenario, arm, run) holding all of it, in
a shape that has nothing aws-bench-specific in it. A different provider's
benchmark emitting the same shape can be presented the same way without the
presentation layer knowing anything about either.

    python3 benchmarks/agent-env/emit-result.py chant-s16-gated
    python3 benchmarks/agent-env/emit-result.py chant-s16-gated --out results/

Fields that exist because of specific ways this went wrong:

  gates       A run whose tooling broke is not a low score, it is not a
              measurement. Four runs carried "command not found" as a note and
              still printed a clean rate.
  trials      Harbor records an exception and carries on with a smaller
              denominator, so a run reported "19/23" with nothing saying the 23
              should have been 24. `expected` is what was asked for.
  independence  Whether the arm answered from state it already held. This is
              the axis the comparison is actually about, and the one that
              carries over to any other provider's benchmark unchanged.
  briefing_sha  The instruction is part of the experiment. Two runs with the
              same code and different briefings are different experiments.
