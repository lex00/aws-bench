"""Prove an arm's own tooling works in the agent container before it is scored.

Run this against every arm before a benchmark job. It stands the arm's workspace
up the way a trial does, runs the commands the arm's briefing teaches, and fails
if any of them cannot answer.

    python3 benchmarks/agent-env/preflight.py                # every arm
    python3 benchmarks/agent-env/preflight.py chant cdk      # named arms

Exit status is nonzero if any arm's tooling is broken, so it can gate a run:

    python3 benchmarks/agent-env/preflight.py cdk && uv run aws-bench run ...

The scenario-1 runs are what this is for. CDK and Alchemy were scored 11/15 and
10/15 without a single `cdk` or `alchemy` command ever executing, and Terraform's
`show -json` was refusing while the agent answered from `cat terraform.tfstate`.
None of that surfaced in a result.json, because a trial that quietly falls back
to jq still produces a reward.
