"""Check, after a job, that every trial actually used the arm's tooling.

Preflight proves the tools work before a run. This proves they were used during
it. A trial whose tool is missing does not error — the agent shrugs, greps the
state files with jq, answers anyway, and the verifier hands out a reward. The
job's result.json looks identical either way, which is how the scenario-1 CDK and
Alchemy arms came to be reported as tool comparisons when no `cdk` or `alchemy`
command ever ran in them.
